              This tip is how a tip should really look. It has a landscape or square image and a small amount of text
              content. This paragraph is in an "info" slot.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is another paragraph in a subsequent "info" slot.
            </p>

            <p>
              This tip has no image. As such, the content area will take up the entire width of the tip.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the next paragraph and should show how wide the content area is now. Of course, the width of the
              overall tip will affect things. In astronomy, the terms object and body are often used interchangeably.

              This tip has an image that is a pretty tall. And the text will run out before the end of the image.
