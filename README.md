# calcite-app-components

A collection of calcite components for building single page applications.

## Features

### [Demos](https://arcgis.github.io/calcite-app-components/)

## Local Dev

### Instructions

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. npm test

### Requirements

- Notepad or your favorite HTML editor
- Web browser with access to the Internet

### Testing

#### Gotchas

Disabling headless mode and enabling devtools causes calls to `page.setContent(<html>)` to fail in end to end tests.
A workaround is manually modifying the waitUntil option in `<projectDir>\node_modules\@stencil\core\dist\testing\index.js` Line 39000 to 'load'.

## Updating Github Pages Docs

1. You'll need to generate a new stencil build for the docs by running `$ npm run docs`.
1. The docs will need to be committed or merged in the `master` branch before they take effect.
