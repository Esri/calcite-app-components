            This tip is how a tip should really look. It has a landscape or square image and a small amount of text
            content. This paragraph is in an "info" slot.

          <p slot="info">
            This is another paragraph in a subsequent "info" slot.

            This tip has no image. As such, the content area will take up the entire width of the tip.
          </p>
          <p slot="info">
            This is the next paragraph and should show how wide the content area is now. Of course, the width of the
            overall tip will affect things. In astronomy, the terms object and body are often used interchangeably.

            This tip has an image that is only 100px by 100px. The image frame sets the width but doesn't force the
            image to be larger than it's native size.
